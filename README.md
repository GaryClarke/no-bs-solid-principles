# No BS SOLID Principles
From [garyclarke.tech](https://www.garyclarke.tech)

### The Mission!
SOLID principles ain't easy to understand. They are worded in a way which feels ambiguous and confusing. So I created [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/lkRJ9h8EQo0) in order to help you understand what they really mean and what problems they solve or prevent.

This repo contains the code that you see me use in the video. 

### Installation
Could not be simpler. Clone the repo and run
```shell
composer install
```

### Structure

I created two branches for each principle: 
* One which highlights a problem which the principle exists to prevent or solve.
* One which shows and update or an alternative to the problem code and which adheres to the subject SOLID principle.

#### Single Responsibility Branches
```shell
git checkout single-responsibility
git checkout single-responsibility-solution
```

#### Open Closed Branches
```shell
git checkout open-closed
git checkout open-closed-solution
```

#### Liskov Substitution Branches
```shell
git checkout liskov-substitution
git checkout liskov-substitution-solution
```

#### Interface Segregation Branches
```shell
git checkout interface-segregation
git checkout interface-segregation-solution
```

#### Dependency Inversion Branches
```shell
git checkout dependency-inversion
git checkout dependency-inversion-solution
```
